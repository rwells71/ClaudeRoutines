# Morning Email & Calendar Digest

You are running an automated morning digest routine for the account owner.
Complete every step below in order. Do not skip any step.

---

## Step 1 — Establish the time window

The digest runs at 5:00 AM Mountain Time. Calculate:

- **Email window**: the 24-hour period ending right now (i.e. the last 24 hours).
  Gmail query: `newer_than:1d`
- **Calendar window**: today (the current date in Mountain Time), from
  `00:00:00` to `23:59:59`, timezone `America/Denver`.

---

## Step 2 — Fetch recent emails

Call `search_threads` with:
- `query`: `newer_than:1d -category:promotions -category:social -category:updates`
- `pageSize`: 50

Repeat with `pageToken` if the response includes one, until all threads are
collected.

For each thread, examine the snippet and message metadata already returned.
If the full body is needed to understand key points or action items, call
`get_thread` with that thread's ID.

**Skip** clearly automated mail: marketing emails, newsletters, messages from
`noreply@`, `no-reply@`, `donotreply@`, or `notifications@` addresses, and any
message with an `List-Unsubscribe` header. Include everything else —
transactional, human-sent, or important system notifications.

---

## Step 3 — Fetch today's non-recurring calendar events

Call `list_events` with:
- `calendarId`: `primary`
- `startTime`: today at `00:00:00` in Mountain Time (ISO 8601 with offset, e.g. `2026-04-25T00:00:00-06:00`)
- `endTime`: today at `23:59:59` in Mountain Time
- `timeZone`: `America/Denver`
- `orderBy`: `startTime`

From the results, **keep only events where ALL of the following are true**:
1. The event does NOT have a `recurringEventId` field.
2. The event does NOT have a `recurrence` field.

These are genuinely one-time events. Drop anything that belongs to a
recurring series.

---

## Step 4 — Summarize

### Emails
Group by sender (use the sender's display name and email address as the heading).
For each sender, list every email they sent in the window. For each email:
- Subject line
- 2–4 bullets covering the key points
- A separate "Action Items" section with concrete, specific tasks required of the reader (omit this section if there are none)

### Calendar events
For each non-recurring event:
- Start and end time (Mountain Time, e.g. "9:00 AM – 10:00 AM MT")
- Event title
- Location or video link (if present)
- One-line description excerpt (if present)

---

## Step 5 — Determine the account owner's email address

Use the following strategy, in order, stopping at the first successful result:

1. Look at the **"To:"** field of every email fetched. Collect all recipient
   addresses. The address that appears most frequently is almost certainly the
   account owner's address — use that.
2. If there is a tie, prefer the address whose domain matches the majority of
   the other addresses in the "To:" fields.
3. If still ambiguous, use the first address found in any "To:" field.

Store this address as `{owner_email}`.

## Step 6 — Create and label the digest draft

### 6a — Create the draft

Call `create_draft` with the following fields:

**`to`**: `["{owner_email}"]`

**`subject`**: `Morning Digest — {Weekday}, {Month} {Day}, {Year}`
  e.g. `Morning Digest — Friday, April 25, 2026`

**`htmlBody`**: Use the HTML template below, substituting real content.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 700px; margin: auto; color: #222;">

<h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #4A90D9; padding-bottom: 8px;">

<p style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9em;">Generated at 5:00 AM Mountain Time</p>

<!-- ====== EMAIL SECTION ====== -->

<!-- Repeat the block below for each unique sender -->
<div style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 12px; background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 4px solid #4A90D9;">

<!-- End event block -->

<!-- If no non-recurring events today, replace event blocks with: -->
<!-- <p><em>No one-time calendar events scheduled for today.</em></p> -->

<hr style="margin-top: 32px;"/>
<p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #999;">Automated digest &mdash; ClaudeRoutines</p>

</body>
</html>
```

### 6b — Label the draft for easy retrieval

After `create_draft` returns a `messageId`, call `label_message` with:
- `messageId`: the ID returned by `create_draft`
- `addLabelIds`: `["INBOX"]`

`INBOX` is a Gmail system label — its ID is literally the string `"INBOX"`.
Do **not** call `list_labels` to look it up; use `"INBOX"` directly.

This moves the draft to the Inbox so it arrives like a normal email rather
than sitting silently in the Drafts folder.

> **Note**: The Gmail MCP integration does not expose a send API. The digest
> is delivered by placing it directly in the Inbox via label assignment.
> If a `send_message` or `send_draft` tool becomes available in a future
> version, prefer that over `label_message`.

## Important rules

- If there are **no emails**, say so clearly; do not omit the section.
- If there are **no non-recurring calendar events**, say so clearly; do not omit the section.
- Keep email summaries concise: maximum 4 bullets per email.
- Action items must be concrete ("Reply to Alice confirming the meeting time")
  not vague ("Follow up").
- Strip tracking pixels and HTML boilerplate from email bodies before summarizing.
- Never include raw HTML or JSON in the digest body.
- If multiple emails from the same sender arrive in the window, group them all
  under one sender heading with separate subject/key-points/action-items blocks.
